Lab Report for lab7

Lab Report done by: Matthew Davenport
                for: Krating Khemkhon

Tester file: test.cpp

All cases tested for positive negative and out of bounds results Passed
except for the copy constructor on the first iteration 

Tested reserving memory for additional companies in the database 
Tested inserting companies into the database 
    both new companies and companies already inserted 
    passed all insertions 

Tested inserting items into companies 
    tested inserting to companies that did not exist in the database 
    tested inserting duplicate items into companies 

Tested erasing items from companies 
    tested erasing items from companies that dont exist 
    tested erasing items that dont exist in existing companies 

Tested erasing companies 
    erased companies that did and did not exist in the database 

Copy constructor was fixed after first iteration 

After this was fixed, tester file was combined with main file provided
Dynamic memory failed and program crashed, unless the destructors
for both the company and database classes were deleted 

This indicates an issue with dynamic memory management
The exact issue was not found. Program does not scale.

Provided both the tester file, and the main file with tester code added to demonstrate
    dynamic memory management failure.
